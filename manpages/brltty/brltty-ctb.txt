Hi.

I just want to introduce a new feature which has just been committed to
the subversion repository: brltty-ctb can now generate and verify
so-colled contraction verification tables.  The idea is simple: You can
use either a word list (/usr/share/dict/words and friends) or some
other large piece of text in your language to generate a contraction
verification table which contains the original text + the actual
contraction of the input, line by line.
If you now apply changes to your actual contraction table, you can
easily verify that they did not introduce any unexpected matches by
verifying the previously written verification table against your
contraction table after you applied your change.
This will list every line of your original input which is now contracted
differently.


programm output:
skainz@zidpc9027:~/tmp/brltty/Programs$ ./brltty-ctb -h
Usage: brltty-ctb [option ...] [{input-file | -} ...]
-c file      --contraction-table=   Contraction table.
-t file      --text-table=          Text table.
-v file      --verification-table=  Contraction verification table.
-r           --reformat-text        Reformat input.
-w columns   --output-width=        Maximum length of an output line.
-f           --force-output         Force immediate output.
-h           --help                 Print a usage summary (commonly used
                                    options only), and then exit.
-H           --full-help            Print a usage summary (all options), and
                                    then exit.
